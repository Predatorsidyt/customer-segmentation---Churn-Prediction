# customer-segmentation---Churn-Prediction
Customer Segmentation: Using unsupervised learning algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering, you can segment customers based on their purchase behavior, location, and other features. This will help businesses to tailor their marketing strategies to different customer segments effectively.
In this code, we first load the data using the pandas library. Then, we drop the 'Unnamed: 0' column.

Next, we split the data into features (X) and the target (y). We also split the data into training and testing sets.

We then create a Random Forest Classifier model and train it using the training data.

Finally, we make predictions on the test set and print the confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.

Next, we create a Random Forest Classifier model and train it using the training data.

We then make predictions on the test set. To evaluate the model's performance, we print the confusion matrix and classification report. The confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The classification report shows the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, as well as the overall accuracy of the model.

These results will help us understand how well the model is able to predict customer churn, and can be used to make any necessary improvements to the model.
